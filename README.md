# Making-the-google-homepage
This project was created in accordance with [The Odin Project: HTML/CSS mini project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).

# Details
This project involved making a clone or look alike of the [Google](https://www.google.com) homepage.
Participants were instructed to use browser developer tools to figure out the layout of the target site but were also encouraged to treat doing so as a last resort and to instead try to figure things out on their own as a sort of review of the knowledge gained in previous sections.

# My take on it
It was a good way of practicalizing everything I had learnt up till that point, I gained valuable insight on positioning elements in a webpage especially centering, realized that dealing with inherited css properties tangled with user-agent css was a nighthmare and thus understood the importance of css resets and finding css property inheritance with dev tools.

# Personal Highlights
One of the highlights of this project was when I got everything looking just right on Chrome and thought I was done only to open it on Edge and and see garbled nonsense, I eventually figured out that some Css properties I used  were not Edge compatible but not after I'd restarted from scratch, and then I had to find properties that were compatible with a significant number of browser versions and rewrite my CSS.

And then I tried loading it on mobile... gooble-de-gok once again, luckily a few edits were all it took.

I felt particularly proud of myself when I got the search box to properly pipe the search terms to google.
